# Lethal Things CCG

## How to Win

The first player to start their turn with 10 Victory Points wins the game.

## Setup

1. Shuffle the deck, and put it into a shared draw pile that all players can reach.
2. Decide on who goes first; the turn order goes clockwise from the first player.
3. The first player draws four cards, while every other player draws six cards.
4. Designate a shared discard pile, as well as a play area in front of every player.
5. Begin playing :)

## Gameplay

At the beginning of each player's turn, Reset all of their cards to show that they can be activated again this turn. Afterwards, the player draws one card.

During each player's turn, the following actions may be used in any order:

* Once per turn, play a card face down. This card is now a resource card; it can be activated to produce resource.
* Any number of times, play a card face up. The player must pay resouces equal to the card's Victory Points.
* Any number of times, activate a card. The player must pay the cost (if any) when activating a card, before doing what the card text says.
* Pass the turn.

At any time, after each player a) starts their turn, b) does an action or c) ends their turn, all other players may activate any number of their cards in response. They must pay any costs required before doing what the card text says.

## Notes

* Lethal Things CCG can be played by at least two players for 10 to 20 minutes per game. Increase the game duration by 10 minutes per extra player.
* Turn activated cards 90 degrees to show that they have been activated. When the cards has been reset, return it to its original position. This is also known as "Tapping" in the popular trading card game Magic: the Gathering.
* If a player tries to draw a card and the shared draw pile is empty, shuffle all the cards in the discard pile and place them in the draw pile. 
* The concept known as "Summoning Sickness" does not apply to this game. Cards may be activated immediately after playing them.
* When building the shared deck, there should only be up to three copies of the same card. There are no maximum deck size, but there should at least be 15 cards per player.
* Some card text are divided into cost and effects by a colon symbol ':'. Most triggers will only activate when an effect happens, but not when paying for a cost.
* You may check the other side of your cards at any time.
