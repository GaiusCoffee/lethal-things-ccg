# Lethal Things CCG

Rules for at least two players, 10 mins per player game time.

## Parts of a Card

At the front of the Card (the "Thing" side), the name of the card is on the top along with its Victory Point value. Below the illustration, there will be a Tag box that contains all of the tags that is associated with the card, and the card text box below it.

The card text box can be divided to the highlighted Cost or Trigger and the card's Effect, seperated by a colon ':'. If the card text does not have a Cost or Trigger, then the effect is always active while it is in the play area.

The back of the Card (the "Resource" side) is mostly the same as the front, except the card name is not visible and there are no Victory Point values.

## How to Win

The first player to start their turn with 10 Victory Points wins the game.

## Setup

1. Shuffle the deck, and put it into a shared draw pile that all players can reach.
2. Decide on who goes first; the turn order goes clockwise from the first player.
3. The first player draws four cards, while every other player draws six cards.
4. Designate a shared discard pile, as well as a play area in front of every player.
5. Begin playing :)

## Gameplay

Each player's turns are divided into two phases: 1) Reset & Draw Phase and the 2) Main Phase

### Reset & Draw Phase

At the beginning of each player's turn, check if the combined total of the cards in their play area is equal or greater than 10. If it is, then that player have won the game.

When cards are activated, they are turned 90 degrees to show that they cannot be activated again. During the Reset Phase, all cards that the current player controls are 'Reset' into their original positions to mark that they can be used again.

After resetting your cards, draw one card from the draw pile.

### Main Phase

During each player's turn, the following actions may be used in any order:

* Once per turn, play a card face down. This card is now a resource card; it can be activated to produce resource.
* Any number of times, play a card face up. The player must pay resouces equal to the card's Victory Points.
* Any number of times, activate a card. The player must pay the cost (if any) when activating a card, before doing what the card text says.
* Pass the turn.

## Notes

* If a player tries to draw a card and the shared draw pile is empty, shuffle all the cards in the discard pile and place them in the draw pile. 
* The concept known as "Summoning Sickness" does not apply to this game. Cards may be activated immediately after playing them.
* Cards can only be activated if the card is in a play area, and only during the controlling player's turn.
* Tags have no inherent effects.
* When building the shared deck, there should only be up to three copies of the same card. There are no maximum deck size, but there should at least be 15 cards per player.
* Most triggers will only activate when an effect happens, but not when paying for a cost.
* You may check the other side of your cards at any time.
